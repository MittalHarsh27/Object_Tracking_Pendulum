# Object Tracking of Pendulum





<br>

# Description

Find the natural frequency of osciallation of a pendulum or any other object using object tracking algorithm in MATLAB by plotting tracked oscillations.


## Methods used



A video of the object oscillating is being feed to the programm, then the user can run the MATLAB code to find the natural frequency
  
     1. Video Processing Toolbox of MATLAB.
     2. Object tracking algorithm of video processing toolbox of MATLAB.



## Contents of this repository

1. Pendulum_tracking.m : A MATLAB script file to run the code for finding the natural frequency.
2. slowpendu.mp4 : Video used to track the position.


## Deployment

To deploy this project run-

  [Pendulum_tracking.m](https://github.com/MittalHarsh27/Object_Tracking_Pendulum/blob/main/Pendulum_tracking.m)



## Features
1. You can change the video according to your choice in order to run the code for any video in which you want to track oscillations.
